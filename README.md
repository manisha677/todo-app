# Todo‑App


A simple **Node.js Todo application** containerized with **Docker** and deployed on **AWS ECS/ECR**.  

It demonstrates how to build a Docker image, push it to AWS ECR, and run it as a containerized task on ECS.  

The app provides basic **CRUD operations** for managing todos, making it a practical demo for cloud deployment workflows. 

Ideal for learning **Docker, AWS ECS, and container orchestration** basics in a hands-on project.


**This project demonstrates how to:**

- Containerize a Node.js application using **Docker**
  
- Push Docker images to **AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**
  
- Deploy and run the application on **AWS ECS** with **Fargate** or **EC2 launch type**
  
- Manage containers and tasks efficiently in the cloud
  


The app itself is simple, featuring basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations for todos, but the main goal is to showcase **end-to-end container deployment workflow** on AWS.  


**Why this project?**  

- Perfect for beginners to learn **Docker + AWS ECS basics**
  
- Provides hands-on experience with **cloud deployment and container orchestration**  


## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Docker installed
  
- AWS account & AWS CLI configured (with permissions for ECR & ECS)
   
- (Optional) Node.js installed — only needed if you want to run without Docker
  

## 🚀 Deployment / Setup Steps


### 1. Clone the repository  


****

### 3. Push Docker Image to AWS ECR


•  Create a repository in AWS ECR.


• Authenticate Docker with ECR:
   
****
    aws ecr get-login-password --region <your-region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
****



• Tag and push image:
   
****
    docker tag todo-app:latest <your-ecr-repo-uri>:latest

    docker push <your-ecr-repo-uri>:latest
****
